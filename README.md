### Hi there, I'm Sarah, a web developer working mainly in PHP. ðŸ‘‹

**SarahSibert/SarahSibert** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app to track fixed costs called MinAmount.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything to do with the TALL stack.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m also working as co-maintainer of Astrotomic.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m also looking for part-time/freelance work.
- âš¡ Fun fact: when I'm not programming, I'm hard at work on our olive farm and looking after our growing number of animals.  
- You can also sponsor my open source work if you're feeling in a generous mood!


**I really need to edit this to make it more exciting but I just don't have a lot of time at the minute.  I'm busy freelancing and when I'm not doing that I'm at my farm weeding the vegetable plot or keeping the cats happy. I also look after our goats and sheep and more and more stray animals by the day. I'm seriously thinking of setting up a funding page just to help with vet and food bills!**
