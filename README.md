### Hi there, I'm Sarah, a web developer working mainly in PHP. 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an app to track fixed costs called MinAmount.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything to do with the TALL stack.
- 👯 I’m also working as co-maintainer of Astrotomic.
- 🤔 I’m also looking for part-time/freelance work.
- ⚡ Fun fact: when I'm not programming, I'm hard at work on our olive farm and looking after our growing number of animals.  
- You can also sponsor my open source work if you're feeling in a generous mood!


I really need to edit this to make it more exciting but I just don't have a lot of time at the minute.  I'm busy freelancing and when I'm not doing that I'm at my farm weding the vegetable plot or keeping the cats happy. I also look after some goats and sheep and more and more stay animals by the day.
