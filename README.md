### Hi there, I'm Sarah, a web developer working mainly in PHP. ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app to track fixed costs called MinAmount.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything to do with the TALL stack.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m also working as co-maintainer of Astrotomic.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m also looking for part-time/freelance work.
- âš¡ Fun fact: when I'm not programming, I'm hard at work on our olive farm and looking after our growing number of animals.  
- You can also sponsor my open source work if you're feeling in a generous mood!
