### Hi there, I'm Sarah, a web developer working mainly in PHP. 👋

<!--
**SarahSibert/SarahSibert** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

**I really need to edit this to make it more exciting but I just don't have a lot of time at the minute.  I'm busy freelancing and when I'm not doing that I'm at my farm weeding the vegetable plot or keeping the cats happy. **


- I’m working on an app to track fixed costs called MinAmount using the TALL Stack which I learn and write about.
- I’m a freelancer (always looking for more work, contact me if you have any) and I am co-maintainer of Astrotomic Open Source.
- You can also sponsor my open source work if you're feeling in a generous mood!
