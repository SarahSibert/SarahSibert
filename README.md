### Hi there, I'm Sarah, a web developer working mainly in PHP. ðŸ‘‹

**I really need to edit this to make it more exciting but I just don't have a lot of time at the minute.  I'm busy freelancing and when I'm not doing that I'm at my farm weeding the vegetable plot or keeping the cats happy. I also look after our goats and sheep and more and more stray animals by the day. I'm seriously thinking of setting up a funding page just to help with vet and food bills!**


- Iâ€™m working on an app to track fixed costs called MinAmount using the TALL Stack which I learn and write about.
- Iâ€™m a freelancer (always looking for more work, contact me if you have any) and I am co-maintainer of Astrotomic Open Source.
- You can also sponsor my open source work if you're feeling in a generous mood!
